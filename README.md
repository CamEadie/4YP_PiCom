# 4YP_PiCom

## Fourth Year Project, Communications Testbed Between Two Rasberry Pi's

The idea of the project is to recreate the functionality of Software Defined Radio Testbeds using low-cost equipment and two Raspberry Pis. The final goal of the project is to have a communication testbed implementing various modulation schemes including On-Off Keying, Pulse Amplitude Modulation, 4- and 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation and Orthogonal Frequency Devision Multiplexing.

The data manipulation is done in python, and the actual control of the GPIO Pins is done using C++ as transition and code execution speeds are much higher.
