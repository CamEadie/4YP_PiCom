Testing Communications and shizniz.
\todo[inline,color=blue!20]{Write Comms Testing}
\textbf{Easily Attainable:}
Construct a basic wired unidirectional communication test bed complete with a transmitter and a receiver.
These units should be synchronised and an appropriate line code (i.e., baseband modulation scheme) should be exploited to convey test data from one device to another.\\

\textbf{Medium Complexity:}
Characterise the performance of the test bed, identifying bandwidth limitations, noise characteristics, and reliability for different modulation and coding schemes. Test specific state-of-the-art modulation techniques recently published in the research literature. (These will be identified by the supervisor).\\

\textbf{Advanced:}
Develop design enhancements that will enable the test bed to be extended to wireless scenarios, including RF and optical wireless systems.
Implement these modifications if the budget permits.
